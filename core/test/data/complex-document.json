"overall_assessment_of_change": "VF Corp faced increasing challenges in fiscal 2024 compared to 2023. The Vans turnaround stalled, wholesale channel pressures intensified especially in the Americas, and overall financial results deteriorated with revenue declines and margin pressure. New leadership is acting with urgency to transform the business through cost reductions, portfolio changes and operational initiatives, but this will take time. Relative bright spots of international growth, The North Face brand strength and DTC resilience continued from 2023. However, the overall tone shifted from stabilizing performance in a transitional 2023 to more aggressive turnaround actions to improve a worsening 2024 trajectory. Risks elevated particularly around Vans, US wholesale and the macro environment. While long-term growth opportunities remain, the path is more uncertain and dependent on strategic execution."
